*About this course*

Learn to create and run Declarative Pipelines with the Blue Ocean Editor, which is the easiest and safest way to define a build. You’ll learn the structure of Declarative Pipeline, how to control the flow of execution, how to save artifacts of the build, and get practice using some of the features that give fit and finish to your Pipeline. The course consists of lectures with follow-along labs plus lab exercises that allow you to practice what you have learned.

*Course Objectives*

After completing this training module, you should understand the following:

• How to create, run, analyze, and save a Declarative Pipeline using the Blue Ocean Editor and the Blue Ocean text editor

• Understand the structure of a Declarative Pipeline, including the role of thestage, step, agent, and post sections 

• How to control the flow of execution in a Declarative Pipeline

• How to preserve and use files created by the build and test activities

• Understand Pipeline capabilities that provide fit and finish to your Pipeline

PLEASE BRING YOUR LAPTOP

AM and PM snacks will be served.

*Audience*

• Beginner and intermediate Developers, QA/Build & Release/DevOps Engineers, and Architects

*Approach*

This course teaches you how to create and run a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline using the Blue Ocean Editor. Students create a real- life Pipeline to build, test, and deploy a Pipeline. The class ends with a quick tour of Pipeline capabilities that provide fit and finish to your Pipeline.

A Pipeline defines all the tasks required to build, test, and deploy an application for Continuous Delivery. It is defined in a Jenkinsfile, which is a text file that is saved to the source code repository where the source code for the application is stored.

A Declarative Pipeline uses an "opinionated" format that protects you from many common pitfalls and does not require that you be an expert in Apache Groovy syntax to create a full-featured Pipeline.

The Blue Ocean Editor is a graphical editor that allows you to define tasks that your Pipeline should run without having to actually write the code. It also provides a text editor that you can use in conjunction with the graphical editor. Blue Ocean executes your code each time you save it and provides a visualization of the execution along with access to detailed logs you can use to debug the Pipeline. It then creates a Pull Request to the Source Code Manager you have configured.
